OVERVIEW
========

This contains some initial work/prototyping on an opentracing backend for use
with Triton and some wrappers to make it easier to integrate with restify.

For some more idea what this is about see [RFD 35](https://github.com/joyent/rfd/tree/master/rfd/0035).

Very Alpha. Not to be used for anything.
